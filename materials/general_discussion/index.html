Not a question but a request. I want to thank you all for very interesting sessions. I see that if I had some basic knowledge I could study more. I want to ask you if it is possible to invite you personally to participate in some Georgian projects either face-to-face or online. As there are no specialists of Digital Textual scholarship in our country.

How much time should you add to a project for coding?  I guess this is a little bit like asking how long is a piece of string... :-/

@Valentina, you might paste here your question again

 I have a very specific question about the semantic web. let's assume that I have a database of inscriptions formed by single epigraphic records and that in these cards there are drop-down menus with standardized items (e.g. supports: vase, stele, etc.). Can I use what Professor Mancinelli showed us to insert my entries with reference to other entries on the web?
thank you!

Reuse and open source are really good points

Yes, right

@valentina  Mignosa - if you have a db you can expose data in LOD

I complete agree with Paolo. My introduction to Python in a Digital Humanities Master in Madrid was taught by computer engineers and all our exercises were about building cash machines and a lot of Maths thing. We didn't see anything of data mining, which was the important use for us of this technology. A change of mind is necessary. As Paolo said, you can teach how it works without mentioning numbers. Fortunately, not all the subjects on the topic are like this ;)

Who educates the educators?
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>12:20</strong><br/>
Yes @Carmen, the question that Tiziana is mentioning right now (who'll teach the teachers?) is key
</p><hr/><p>
Carmen García

A similar question was asked some days ago on Twitter

(relating to the discussion about DH in italy)I think it depens on what you are going to work on. For example I'm working on ER db and without math (relational algebra maybe? i don't now the exact translation)  I could not completely comprehend queries' structures and how to obtain correct answers from my archive. 
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>12:21</strong><br/>
Also, I think it's important to bear in mind Tito Orlandi's point (and Guido Milanese's, and of other DHers) that "Informatica Umanistica" is a humanistic matter

Totally agrre. You don't have to be an engineer to drive a car, but having an idea about how an engine works may help; at least when the car stops in the middle of nothing :) That's an interdisciplinary team-work, just like today nobody is writing a dictionary on his own. Ars longa, vita brevis...
</p><hr/><p>
Tiziana MANCINELLI
<strong>12:30</strong><br/>
Totally agree

+1 -- T. Olrandi once used the same metaphor. He said that peopole in fact  do have a basic understanding of how an automobile motor works (burning fuel etc.), but often have no even basic understanding of IT -- It's a black box

I am really grateful to everyone for having been part of this course this week. It has been amazing and very informative especially for me. I was not so familiar with this, just in theory and not in practice, but it is essential both for my project and my work as an archivist. Thank you very much
