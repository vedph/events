Great, thank you for opening up the session!
Sophie Große
11:03
That's great, thanks!

Our materials: https://vedph.github.io/summercamp/materials/visualisation/

Slides are in https://vedph.github.io/summercamp/materials/visualisation/Xslt_short.pptx

XML <num>15</num>

is transformed into

HTML <span class="nr">15</span>
Then CSS says: all HTML <span> elements that have class="nr" must be shown in red
Tu
11:20
This can be achieved by means of many programming languages (I mostly use JavaScript or Python), but XSLT has been created specificall for that task
Daniele FUSI
11:20
As a general comment: from XML to HTML we are actually losing information. It's a presentational layer: many things get the same appearance. E.g. a person name or a place name can both just become italic; and italic it's just that: italic. Representation is much richer and for XML we have several dialects for each specific conceptual domain.
Tu
11:25
All materials
...including the final XML to use
are in https://vedph.github.io/summercamp/materials/visualisation/
Please go there and download all materials
Direct link to the GItHub folder with the materials: https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
please download all files in the github folder
Tu
11:26
transform.xpr
VeDPH - unive
11:26
if you want to preserve as much information as possible in a transformation, you must re-arrange the information; for exmaple, the name of an XML tag can become the class of a HTML tag: XML-TEI <persName><forename>Federico</forename></persName> becomes, in HTML, <span class="persName"><span class="forename">Federico</span></span>
Gaia Tomazzoli
11:26
I never get how to download files from github
Valentina MIGNOSA
11:27
me too
Tu
11:27
1) Download everything in https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
2) open with double click on transform.xpr
Chloé Tardivel
11:27
me too
Gaia Tomazzoli
11:27
ok, it's on google drive
but since we're here
Janyce Desiderio
11:28
I'm not sure you can download from github if you don't have an account
Gaia Tomazzoli
11:28
would it be possible to explain how to download from github?
Janyce Desiderio
11:28
(it's not a sure affirmation ...)
VeDPH - unive
11:28
if you just transform <persName><forename>Federico</forename></persName> in <span><span>Federico</span></span> you lose information
Sara Ayres
11:28
If I may ask Tiziana, how much time should you add to a transcription and translation project of 15,000 words for coding? 
Daniele FUSI
11:28
#All: ensure to download ALL the files, and put them in the SAME folder. The resulting HTML has some dependencies (CSS and JS), which are to be found in the same directory.
Janyce Desiderio
11:29
(otherwise you clone the repository)
Tu
11:29
OK done
Now it's a zip file
step by step:
1) go to https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
2) right click → download as / save as
3) unzip it 
VeDPH - unive
11:30
Two documents are isomorphic if exists a transfromation from A to B and a reverse transforamtion form B to A, without loss of information.
Tu
11:30
4) click on transform.xpr
Tu
11:31
If you have tech issues, join me in https://8x8.vc/paolomonella/paolo.monella for personal tutoring
Chloé Tardivel
11:32
all clear thanks !
Tu
11:34
If you don't have 'save as', do 'save link' from GitHub
Valentina MIGNOSA
11:34
yes
Chloé Tardivel
11:34
yes
Christian D'Agata
11:34
yes
Janyce Desiderio
11:34
yes
Michele Sollecito
11:34
yes
Silvia Gazzoli
11:34
yes
Y. Faghihi
11:38
Could you just show the next step as well..again 
Valentina MIGNOSA
11:38
do we have to select 'Transformation options'?
Y. Faghihi
11:38
I mean the visualisation
Daniele FUSI
11:38
Open the XML and then pick Document/Transformation/Configure Transformation Scenario just click apply no option required
Tu
11:38
I added a sub-folder in the github with the same files unzipped, just in case you have issues with the ZIP file https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
Daniele FUSI
11:39
BTW The warning appearing after applying is a developer's commodity to make sure he did not forget to match some tags from the TEI document by mistake. "Forgetting" a text node here is OK, because a text node is copied by default as it is.
Gaia Tomazzoli
11:40
didn't they cancel the Redentore?
maybe just the fireworks?
we don't hear it
Sara Ayres
11:43
is it possible to have two IIF images from different sources on the same page, to facilitate comparison? 
Yes in the presentation :-)

Sara Ayres
11:45
Thanks for this link!
Daniele FUSI
11:45
Also but take into account that a web presentation targets multiple devices and usually this means we must be prepared to face dramatically different screen sizes. There are ways to provide different CSS rules for different media anyway, that's called responsivity.
Valentina MIGNOSA
11:46
I have a very specific question about the semantic web. let's assume that I have a database of inscriptions formed by single epigraphic records and that in these cards there are drop-down menus with standardized items (e.g. supports: vase, stele, etc.). Can I use what Professor Mancinelli showed us to insert my entries with reference to other entries on the web?
Tu
11:46
Alberto's answer pertains to an individual wanting to see two images vis-a-vis; my answer pertains to the webpage of your scholarly digital edition linking text & image

Not a question but a request. I want to thank you all for very interesting sessions. I see that if I had some basic knowledge I could study more. I want to ask you if it is possible to invite you personally to participate in some Georgian projects either face-to-face or online. As there are no specialists of Digital Textual scholarship in our country. 
Sara Ayres
11:53
How much time should you add to a project for coding?  I guess this is a little bit like asking how long is a piece of string... :-/
Tu
11:55
@Valentina, you might paste here your question again

Reuse and open source are really good points

Yes, right

@valentina  Mignosa - if you have a db you can expose data in LOD 
Carmen García
12:15
I complete agree with Paolo. My introduction to Python in a Digital Humanities Master in Madrid was taught by computer engineers and all our exercises were about building cash machines and a lot of Maths thing. We didn't see anything of data mining, which was the important use for us of this technology. A change of mind is necessary. As Paolo said, you can teach how it works without mentioning numbers. Fortunately, not all the subjects on the topic are like this ;)

Daniel Kiss
12:20
Who educates the educators?
Tu
12:20
Yes @Carmen, the question that Tiziana is mentioning right now (who'll teach the teachers?) is key
Carmen García
12:21
A similar question was asked some days ago on Twitter
Silvia Gazzoli
12:21
(relating to the discussion about DH in italy)I think it depens on what you are going to work on. For example I'm working on ER db and without math (relational algebra maybe? i don't now the exact translation)  I could not completely comprehend queries' structures and how to obtain correct answers from my archive. 
Tu
12:21
Also, I think it's important to bear in mind Tito Orlandi's point (and Guido Milanese's, and of other DHers) that "Informatica Umanistica" is a humanistic matter

Totally agrre. You don't have to be an engineer to drive a car, but having an idea about how an engine works may help; at least when the car stops in the middle of nothing :) That's an interdisciplinary team-work, just like today nobody is writing a dictionary on his own. Ars longa, vita brevis...
Tiziana MANCINELLI
12:30
Totally agree
Tu
12:31
+1 -- T. Olrandi once used the same metaphor. He said that peopole in fact  do have a basic understanding of how an automobile motor works (burning fuel etc.), but often have no even basic understanding of IT -- It's a black box
Sara Ayres
12:33
Thanks so much, really fascinating!
Tiziana MANCINELLI

I am really grateful to everyone for having been part of this course this week. It has been amazing and very informative especially for me. I was not so familiar with this, just in theory and not in practice, but it is essential both for my project and my work as an archivist. Thank you very much
Mila Fumini
12:33
Linda is super!
Tiziana MANCINELLI
12:33
