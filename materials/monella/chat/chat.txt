yes! I've used Tiziana's tool for the Documenti d'amore

I recently learned how to create IIIF manifests with my own images and already existing institutional IIIF images and I am eager to continue to experiment with IIIF. -	My main problem is that most institutions which own the manuscripts related to my digital edition project are not using IIIF: I started to employ static images with the hope to get in the future institutional IIIF files of my project manuscripts (which I am not sure will ever exist), but I am not sure if it makes sense...
Tu
15:36
Yes, right, she developed that tool for the Documenti d'Amore project in the BIFLOW ERC
Giuditta Cirnigliaro
15:36
Also, at the moment I have a TEI file with my transcriptions and some IIIF manifests with my annotations: is it reasonable, to integrate them? If I do as you explained earlier, I should link any single IIF ‘default’ image to my edition, not all of the at once, right? In the end I feel I don’t get a lot more than by using my local image. Can you tell a bit about how to integrate annotations, then?

a recent project that is trying to use IIIF and especially to push libraries to adopt IIIF is Illuminated Dante Project

Yes, definitely IIIF is not only for MS page images: it's also for drawings in museums etc.
Beth Fischer

On the museum side (less archive/library), some central database management tools are starting to create IIIF manifests as part of their services. Since many smaller institutions don't have custom tools, this will make it much more possible for them. Typically the digital resources delivery is not handled in-house.  TMS is one such org that is just implementing IIIF.

The Spanish National Library is now allowing the use of its images for any purpose without paying. They have been a great work and effort for digitizing lots of items, but they have not considered, it seems, the IIIF protocol

Probably, if we philologists start massively integrating IIIF into our digital editions, we help libraries to show the funding bodies the utility of IIIF
