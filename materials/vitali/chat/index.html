One more minor correction to he record ;) I think Piranesi's maecenas was James Caulfeild (sic), 4th Viscount Charlemont (and from 1763, 1st Earl of Charlemont). https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/james-caulfeild-4th-viscount-charlemont-later-1st-earl-of-charlemont-245553

Thank you a lot Fabio for being "historians" in critically looking at data. It was fascinating. How would you translate research hypothesis into searchable and interoperable metadata then? A specific field, a free text space saying about all the possible contradictions in available information ? Your data standard will not be the one used by the library next door so how to proceed if we agree you are right in analysing critically basic descriptive data for our cultural heritage? Which strategy?

Great talksmall question: 
<p><strong>
Diego CALAON
<strong>16:17</strong><br/>
</strong>
Do you think that the public nature of funding/bodies of sites and/or repository like Europeans influenced this boring "data" storage? The gfact that they are paid with  public/politic. funds is related to the non conflictual nuance of the presented data? 
<p><strong>
serge noiret
<strong>16:18</strong><br/>
</strong>
